# INSTALL
-----
on linux terminal:
```
cd ~/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TSARSOFT/TSARED/master/install.sh
chmod 777  ~/install.sh
~/install.sh
```
this will install/update the latest version of TSARED!
note: you can also use curl instead of wget if you prefer.
if you want to run TSARED just by running `TSARED`, as root use `cp ~/TSARSOFT/TSARED/run.sh /bin/tsared`, make sure that TSARED is installed first though.
